This repository is the 3rd week project in the 201 class. The Busmall app is small website that uses a preselected image directory to generate at makeshift focus poll. We have made up user stories to simulate actual people this could be marketed to.  This is simple app has a layer of complexity in that the sets of three random images which people choose from are randomly generated from the directory and their cannot be repeats in the set.
